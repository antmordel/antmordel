### Hola ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nito. I'm a full-time software engineer. And I love learning new stuff related to engineering. My main motivation is
to do applications that are heavily used and which use-cases matter (i.e. **software that matters**). Attracted by
difficult performance problems. ðŸ’¬ Truly believer of T-shaping. A software engineer should be able to run an app from the
architecture design, to the deployment and to the maintenance in production.

Since I mainly learn from others, I also want to give back to the community creating some learning content, which you
might find below.
